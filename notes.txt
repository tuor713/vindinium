ideas for bots
- incentive maps: i.e. mines provide incentive, weaker heros do, stronger heros don't, taverns do
  incentives are set according to health
- conditional agent: alpha-beta for small crowded maps

Additions
> Combat
- ensure that fields adjacent to taverns are treated preferentially
- finishing off an opponent i.e. moving into the bad +2 square because the life difference is big enough
- don't mine when in an enemy square unless you can still win

> Meta
- learn from death i.e. avoid death spots ?
- avoid traps i.e. don't go into places where you can be cut off completely, especially if an enemy is very near
- avoid mining clashes where two bots take and re-take a mine
- avoid being trailed by another bot stealing my mines

> Planning
- go to tavern nearest to next mine etc
- sometimes dependent on half-life time of mines held making strategic plans is not best :(
- plan out full circle i.e. plan which tavern to go to after mining, plan which mine to go to after visiting tavern
- go into territory least claimed by other bots (large maps)

> Heuristics
- Tavern proximity: if in doubt stay closer to the nearest tavern, in particular when facing enemies
- Enemy mine preference: should we prioritise taking mines from enemies? should we prioritise farming in areas
  of low combat?

> AB search
- 100k n/s
- 2 ply search tree with all bots counted in => pathetic


Games to review
k3h2u2th (local) => very restrictive arena conquering and holding important, some crap deaths ?
