ideas for bots
- incentive maps: i.e. mines provide incentive, weaker heros do, stronger heros don't, taverns do
  incentives are set according to health
- conditional agent: alpha-beta for small crowded maps

to review
http://vindinium.org/wa0n8mca-> this could be done as strict alpha-beta
http://vindinium.org/bvx6xpym -> some random deaths that should be preventable
http://vindinium.org/u8sqpoeh -> non tavern behaviour
http://vindinium.org/ge1ccdij -> foolish death after reaching tavern ...

Additions
> Combat
- don't be afraid to into T+1 space if we can still win
- ensure that fields adjacent to taverns are treated preferentially
- finishing off an opponent i.e. moving into the bad +2 square because the life difference is big enough

> Meta
- learn from death i.e. avoid death spots ?
- avoid traps i.e. don't go into places where you can be cut off completely, especially if an enemy is very near

> Path finding
- allow alternative equivalent paths to mines and taverns, to enable finer grain optimizations
- without DFS based mining, we greedily optimize the first mine but that is not really right




Have a private Arena for running games with test agents ...
- predefined maps that I played
- set of agents (current malvert, random bot, stay bot, next malvert, etc) ... we'd have to take 
  branches of the code to have the current bot exactly as is ...
  maybe actually I will compile it into separate jars and have backups of agents in separate classloaders
  ... mwahaha
