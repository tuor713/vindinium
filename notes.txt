;; ideas for bots
;; - incentive maps: i.e. mines provide incentive, weaker heros do, stronger heros don't, taverns do
;;   incentives are set according to health
;; - conditional agent: alpha-beta for small crowded maps

;; to review
;; http://vindinium.org/wa0n8mca -> this could be done as strict alpha-beta
;; http://vindinium.org/bvx6xpym -> some random deaths that should be preventable
;; http://vindinium.org/u8sqpoeh -> non tavern behaviour
;; http://vindinium.org/ge1ccdij -> foolish death after reaching tavern ...

;; to add
;; - if a tavern is blocked by an enemy, well then don't go there
;; - finishing off an opponent i.e. moving into the bad +2 square because the life difference is big enough
;; - avoid spawning spots and adjacent
;; - combat if standing next to a tavern on one life go into it ...
;; - could experiment with blacklisting taverns / mines that either
;;   - cannot be reached (enemy blocking)
;;   - lead to vicious cycles of death
;; - learn from death i.e. avoid death spots ?
;; - avoid traps i.e. don't go into places where you can be cut off completely, especially if an enemy is very near
