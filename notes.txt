ideas for bots
- incentive maps: i.e. mines provide incentive, weaker heros do, stronger heros don't, taverns do
  incentives are set according to health
- conditional agent: alpha-beta for small crowded maps

Additions
> Combat
- finishing off an opponent i.e. moving into the bad +2 square because the life difference is big enough
- avoid death spots
  - add a higher multiplier if an enemy is actually near (say T+1 or T+2 spot)
  - make a force field of dead ends vectors rather than naive unsafe, semi-unsafe classification

> Meta
- avoid mining clashes where two bots take and re-take a mine
- avoid being trailed by another bot stealing my mines

> Planning
- go to tavern nearest to next mine etc
- sometimes dependent on half-life time of mines held making strategic plans is not best :(
- plan out full circle i.e. plan which tavern to go to after mining, plan which mine to go to after visiting tavern
- go into territory least claimed by other bots (large maps)
- Efficiency: 
  ? use planning as generation of shortest path strips to generate routes (as opposed to blind search)
  ? cache planning results in the same turn
  ? cache planning over turns

> Heuristics
- Tavern proximity: if in doubt stay closer to the nearest tavern, in particular when facing enemies
- Enemy mine preference: should we prioritise taking mines from enemies? should we prioritise farming in areas
  of low combat?

> Gammas
- how to combine advanced cross heuristics such as avoiding mining in dead spots when opponents are near (death spot (combat), mining)
- mining under fire (combat, mining)

> Strategic
- territorial behaviour i.e. claim a set of mines and defend them ? (check that gold production is winning)



> AB search
- 100k n/s
- 2 ply search tree with all bots counted in => pathetic


Games to review
k3h2u2th (local) => very restrictive arena conquering and holding important, some crap deaths ?
